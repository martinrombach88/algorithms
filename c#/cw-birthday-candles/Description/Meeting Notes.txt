Following the completion of the challenge, the goal is to refactor the program using OOP.
After building classes to a basic level, here is the recommended structure:



New Classes are
Important - building individual units to be listed is very important for OOP
Candle - an individual candle with a property of an int

CandleList - a list of Candle instances

Blower - an instance of a process which blows out a sequence of candles. 
provides a method which returns the number of blows required to blow out a sub list.
Has to return the remaining sublist (i.e. 1 2 1 -> 0 1 0)

BlowCounter - receives a candle list and feeds a set of sequences to an instance/instances of a blower/blowers (if you can do it with 1 blower thatâ€™s best). it sums all counts from each blow and returns the sum.
