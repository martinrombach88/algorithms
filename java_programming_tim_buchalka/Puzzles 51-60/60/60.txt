It's now time for a LinkedList challenge.
I'm going to ask you to use LinkedList functionality, to create a list of places,
ordered by distance from the starting point. And we want to use a ListIterator, to move,
both backwards and forwards, through this ordered itinerary of places.
First, create a type that has a Town or place name, and a field for
storing the distance from the start. Next, create an itinerary of places
or towns to visit, much like we've been doing in the last few videos.
But this time, instead of Strings, you'll want to create a LinkedList of your place or Town type.
Here we show a list of a few places in Australia, and their distances from Sydney.
You'll create a LinkedList, ordered by the distance from
the starting point, in this case Sydney. Your start point should be the first element in your list.
And You don't want to allow duplicate places to be in your list, for this data set.
In addition, you'll create an interactive program with the following menu item options.
The menu will have options to move forwards and backwards through your itinerary,
to list the itinerary, and print menu options and quit the program.
You'll want to use a Scanner, and the nextLine method, to get input from the console.
You'll use a ListIterator, to move forwards and backwards,
through the list of places on your itinerary.


//To do:
/1.Organise list by order as a well as removing duplicates.
- Use a for loop with a distance comparison if block/ternary to organise the
- distances. The comparison should use <.
