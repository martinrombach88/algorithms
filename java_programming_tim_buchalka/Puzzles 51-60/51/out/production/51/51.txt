Smart Kitchen

In this challenge, you need to create an application for controlling a smart kitchen.
Your smart kitchen will have several appliances.

Your appliances will be Internet Of Things  (IoT) devices, which can be programmed.
For example, you might do stuff in your kitchen  in the morning, in a rush to get to work,
and then expect your smart kitchen appliances  to run automatically at a later time.

It's your job to write the code, to enable your Smart Kitchen application, to execute certain jobs.
Methods on your SmartKitchen class, will determine what work needs to be done: addWater() will set the
Coffee Maker's hasWorkToDo field to true. pourMilk() will  also set Refrigerator's hasWorkToDo to true.
And finally loadDishwasher() will set the  hasWorkToDo flag to true, on that appliance.

To execute the work needed to be done by the appliances, you'll implement this in two ways:
First, your application will access each appliance  (by using a getter), and execute a method.
The appliance methods are orderFood() on  Refrigerator, doDishes() on DishWasher, and b
rewCoffee() on CoffeeMaker. These methods should check the hasWorkToDo flag,
and if true, print a message out, about what work is being done.

Second, your application won't access the appliances directly.
It should call doKitchenWork(), which  delegates the work, to any of its appliances.
You'll have to create the appliances as classes, with their own methods, then
compose your smart kitchen with these appliances.
