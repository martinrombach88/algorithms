In this challenge, you will need to create a simple banking

application, with a Customer and Bank type. The Customer will have a name, and an ArrayList of

transactions containing Double wrapper elements. A customer's transaction can be a credit,

which means a positive amount, or it can be a debit, a negative amount.

The Bank will have a name, and an ArrayList of customers.

The bank should add a new customer, if they're not yet already in the list.

The bank class should allow a customer to add a transaction, to an existing Customer.

This class should also print a statement, that includes the customer name,

and the transaction amounts. This method should use unboxing.

Ok, so hopefully that's fairly clear, but gives you a little room to be creative.

Alright, so it's your turn to see if you can create something like this.

Remember, it doesn't have to be terribly complicated, just keep it pretty basic.

The customer's literally only the name and the transactions at this stage.

You don't need to store customer contract addresses or anything like that.

The main thing is the relationship between the various classes, and also the auto

boxing and unboxing. Pause the video now.
