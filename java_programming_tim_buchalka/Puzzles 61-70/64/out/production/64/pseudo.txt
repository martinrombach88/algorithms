PSEUDO CODE
Class League Table is an ArrayList of teams.
Make two leagues in the instances: a baseball league and a soccer league
Player lists are an array property of the team class

You need to use generics (T) to gain something from this exercise

Class LeagueTable {
    fields:
    string name,
    array list teams
    (no enum - the teams in the generic param will define it)

    methods:
    add team (with generic type validation)

    print table (sorts arraylist in order of wins):
    for loop
    rank is wins - losses.
    for (i in teams) {
        nested loop?

    }
}

Class Team {
    string name
    ArrayList Players -> length should be in the constructor
    int wins
    int losses
    int draws
}
