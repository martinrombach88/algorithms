PSEUDO CODE
Class League Table is an ArrayList of teams.
Make two leagues in the instances: a baseball league and a soccer league
Player lists are an array property of the team class

You need to use generics (T) to gain something from this exercise

Class LeagueTable {
    fields:
    String name,
    array list teams
    (no enum - the teams in the generic param will define it)

    methods:
    add team (with duplicate validation)

    print table (sorts arraylist in order of wins):
    for loop
    rank is wins - losses.
    You can't calculate the value within the for loop and sort it.
    You need one value for each team. This can be calculated by win/loss/draw

    Difference for sorting algorithm - you are sorting by the rank
    field, not a list of ints.

    Key question: How are you going to sort it?
    How will you compare the numbers of the object?
    How will you sort those numbers?
    What will be done with an object once you know it's place in the list?

    Options:
    Use an auto sorter to sort by rank
    Build a sorting algorithm based on algo concepts - best!
    Maybe you can do 2 or 3 sorting algorithms for this!
}

Class Team {
    String name
    String[] players
    int wins
    int losses

}
