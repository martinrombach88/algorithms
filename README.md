# algorithms
A collection of coding puzzles.

As I transitioned to a backend focus and change my main language to Java, I wanted to save my algorithm history.
It acts as a way of organising the code for myself and demonstrating my experiences to others.

Collection:

1. Tim Buchalka, Java Programming  - Puzzles from Course (59 puzzles, Java)
2. LEET Code (1 puzzle, Javascript)
3. Advent of Code 2022 (5 puzzles, Python)
4. Misc (3 puzzles, Javascript)
