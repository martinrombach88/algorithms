A collection of coding puzzles.

As I transitioned to a backend focus and change my main language to Java, I wanted to save my problem history.
It acts as a way of organising the code for myself and demonstrating my experiences to others.

Collection:

1. Java fundamentals ('Complete Programming MasterClass - Tim Buchalka') - Puzzles from Course (32 puzzles)
2. LEET Code (1 puzzle)
3. Advent of Code 2022 (5 puzzles)
