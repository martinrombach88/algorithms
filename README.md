# algorithms
A collection of coding problems.

As I transitioned to a backend focus and change my main language to Java, I wanted to save my problem history.
It acts as a way of organising the code for myself, and demonstrating to employers the problems I face.

While there are some Python puzzles from where I was comparing Python with Java through the Christmas Advent of Code challenge, I expect future puzzles will be solved in either Java or Javascript.
