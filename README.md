# algorithms
A collection of coding puzzles.

As I transitioned to a backend focus and change my main language to Java, I wanted to save my algorithm history.
It acts as a way of organising the code for myself and demonstrating my experiences to others.

2. Tim Buchalka - Java Masterclass (Udemy): 67 puzzles
