Create a program using arrays,  that sorts a list of integers,

in descending order.  Descending order  means from highest value to lowest.

In other words, if the array has the values  50, 25, 80, 5, and 15, your program should

return an array, with the values in the  descending order: 80, 50, 25, 15,  and 5.

First, create an array of  randomly generated integers.

If you don't know how to do this,  be sure to watch the previous video.

Print the array before you sort it. And print the array after you sort it.

You can choose to create a new sorted  array, or just sort the current array.

In the last video, I showed you  how to use the Arrays.sort method,

but that sorts from lowest to highest. This challenge is for you to sort in reverse,

or descending order. In addition, you should use the Arrays.toString method,

to print out  your array before, and after sorting.

If you want to, you can make a  copy of the array before sorting.

It's time now to pause the video,  and actually try out this challenge.

If you get stuck, or when you're finished, and  you're ready to check my version of the solution,

come back, and I'll show you how I did it. Pause the video now.
