Use the leap year method from the previous challenge.

Write another method getDaysInMonth with two parameters month and year.  ​Both of type int.

If parameter month is < 1 or > 12 return -1. ​

If parameter year is < 1 or > 9999 then return -1.

This method needs to return the number of days in the month. Be careful about leap years they have 29 days in month 2 (February).

You should check if the year is a leap year using the method isLeapYear described above.

Examples of input/output:

getDaysInMonth(1, 2020); → should return 31 since January has 31 days.

getDaysInMonth(2, 2020); → should return 29 since February has 29 days in a leap year and 2020 is a leap year.

getDaysInMonth(2, 2018); → should return 28 since February has 28 days if it's not a leap year and 2018 is not a leap year.

getDaysInMonth(-1, 2020); → should return -1 since the parameter month is invalid.

getDaysInMonth(1, -2020); → should return -1 since the parameter year is outside the range of 1 to 9999.



HINT: Use the switch statement.

NOTE: Methods isLeapYear and getDaysInMonth need to be public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
