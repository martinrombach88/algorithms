Creating instances
Packages allow you to access both constructors and static methods.

Now you're working with an application that multiplies a 
provided number by 200. There's a special class that is used for
 operating on large numbers called BigInteger.

In this task, you will need to access this class without 
importing it. Its constructor accepts only one argument: 
a string with a number (for example, "1264"). I
t is located in the java.math package.

You need to create an instance of this class with the number
 given in the method, and return it.

The program will then multiply it â€“ you don't need to 
perform multiplication.


Sample Input:
49225

Sample Output:
49225 multiplied by 200 is 9845000
