In a Java program, you see the following code that successfully 
compiles and executes.

Cookie cookie = new Cookie("chocolate chips"); 
Select all true statements.

Select one or more options from the list

OPTION: The class Cookie has a constructor with one formal 
parameter of the type String.

True -> A string is passed to new Cookie, if what we see compiles,
it must accept 1 string as a param.

OPTION: The object cookie must have a field filled by the value "chocolate chips"
False -> There is no indication that the string must be strictly 
"chocolate chips" it can be anything.

OPTION: The class Cookie has a constructor without parameters.
False -> See below

OPTION: The class Cookie has the default constructor.
False -> See below

If we write our own constructor (with one or more parameters) 
we "lose" the default no-args constructor that java automatically 
generated for us hence, to create an instance of that class we must 
use the constructor we just created. 
If we try to use a no-args constructor we will get compile-error.
If we pass arguments to the constructor we free to ignore that argument.

OPTION: The class Cookie has a constructor with the name Cookie.
True -> we can see the constructor is named Cookie.
Constructors always have the same name as the original class.
