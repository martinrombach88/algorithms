Check IP address
An IP address consists of four numbers from 0 to 255, inclusive, divided by the dots. For example, 127.0.0.1 is a valid IP address, but 256.0.0.1 and 127.0.1 are invalid IP addresses.

For a given string output "YES" if this string is a valid IP address, otherwise output "NO".

1) First  check whether the IP is valid or not
2) If the IP is valid  split the  ip address using split() method
3) After splitting check whether each entity of ip address is 8 bit ( not greater than 255) , don't forget to convert the each entity of IP to Integer  use Integer.parseInt(String) method . 
4) Implement rest of the part yourself without any help, should be easier after this much practice.
