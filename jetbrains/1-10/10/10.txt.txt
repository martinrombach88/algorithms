Kate's math function
Here is a math function that Kate wants to use in her program:

f(x)=
x squared + 1 if x < 0
1 / x squared if 0 < x < 1
x squared - 1 if x > 1

The template for this function is defined below. Let's decompose it!

Your task is to create three additional methods f1, f2, and f3 for each case and complete the method f. 
Each method should accept x as an argument with double type.
