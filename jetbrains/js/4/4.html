    <h1>Caesar cipher</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever heard of a Caesar cipher? Let's try to encrypt a small
      message in a similar fashion! Write a code that reads a string from the
      input, adds 1 to the code point of every character and outputs the
      encrypted string.

      HINT by avatar sahil khan you should learn for loop before solving this
      question. You can solve without that also but if you are a beginner than
      it will make the task easy.
